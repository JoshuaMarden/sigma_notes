### Applying STARR  to personal anecdotes
___

__Msci Data:

S -> I was working with neuroimaging data set for Master's dissertation at KCL. Evetual goal was to find changes in activity patterns across neural networks.

T -> I was given a walkthrough of how to clean and structure the data set. This is is very complex and requires new software and command line usage which I was unfamiliar with.

A -> I spent a week trying to get it to work. Could not get the data software to behave. Dissolved a whole weekend trying to fix this problem. Baring in mind this is not something you can find the answer to on the internet.

R -> Ended up having to ask for help. It turns out the very night I was shown, an update was rolled out on the University system that interfered with the software. I had no idea, and could not have known.

R -> Ask for help sooner. Brute force can waist time

Try to control the environment you work in. After this happened I ran everything locally. You cannot rely on unknown IT departments you have no shared goals with.

___Vosges Hike

S -> Had to do a demanding hike through the vosges in the middle of summer, away from running water for 3 days. Very hot by day, cold by night. Not awful.

T ->


### Guidance on Open Questions
___
Its hard to answer these and the commonly used frameworks are a bit weak,

1. Focus on a theme / story / narrative
2. Be selective. Don't go beyond three points regarding examples. Never go beyond three minutes when explain.
3. Show your personality. Be a person
4. Can you exhibit the behaviours the institutions desire?

### "Tell Me About Yourself"
___

Write an answer for this. Articulative and detailed.

Then bullet point it, so that it can be adapted and rattled off with ease.
