##### "Root Cause Analysis"

A question of defining the question correctly.

1. Define the problem
   - Analyse what you see.
2. Collect data
   - Do you have evidence of the problem or its outcome?
3. Identify possible causal factors
   - Okay - what's causing it?
   - '[5 Why](https://businessmap.io/lean-management/improvement/5-whys-analysis-tool)' problem solving can be used.
4. Identify the root cause(s)
   - 
2. Recommend and implement solutions



### SCQA
---
##### "Situation, Complication, Question, Answer"


1. What situation are you talking about?
2. What's the problem?
3. What's the question?
4. What's the solution.


#### SCQA Coursework

__Situation:__
Nokia went from being the King of Mobile to being a complete did-not-compete in the modern technology market. You don't see Nokia in the news today, and you don't see Nokia products. The company still exists but is slowly dying. They remain a muti-billion pound enterprise, but have completely surrendered the market they used to dominate. Now they are restricted to supplying infrastructure that other mobile brands can utilise while their share price wanes.

__Problem:__
Nokia was observably left in the dust as they failed to innovate, overestimated brand loyalty as they pumped out stale products, and utilised an inspired Microsoft OS which flopped. Despite telecoms still being a key and fats-paced market. They seem committed to their slow death. Did you know Nokia 'came-back' into smart phones back in 2016? No one seems to.

__Question__
The question is simple. How does Nokia break back into the smartphone market successfully? How does it attract users and emerge from the 90's and 00's as the face of the future?

__Solution:__
I can't give paint-by-numbers solution, however we can sketch a rough map of how a company with an annual revenue of €20 Billion might rejoin the party. Nokia was originally toppled because they failed to innovate. Contrast this with Samsungs strange obsession with making screens curve or fold; or perhaps with Apple's obsession with adding cameras to their phones. Both leading brands are striving to replace more and more of the gadgets in our lives, all while making their product lighter, thinner, and more aesthetic.

People clearly want something new, something different. Markets flock to new technologies, often when they're not even particularly useful. This is where the compass points

- Nokia needs to roll the dice and __innovate__. This starts with a dedicated innovation lab. 
- Start pursuing technologies that utilise:
	  1. Blockchain
	  2. AI
	  3. Internet of things
- Use the above technologies to seek out or aggressively poach leading minds.
- Build or adopt a proper software ecosystem.
- Spend 5-7 years developing a product that will create it's own niche, stealing as much marketshare from Samsung, Apple, and other Chinese brands as required.

Things to consider:
	 - Interest rates are going to start declining, governments cannot roll over pandemic debt at high rates.
	 - Quantitative easing will be deployed to deflate the debt.
	 - This is good for long-duration tech as you can borrow at low rates. You get to sell your future product at future market prices but you will be paying down debt at today's prices.
	 - Huawei and other Chinese manufacturers are not trusted due to security concerns, meaning there a slight imbalance in competition against some market competitors.
