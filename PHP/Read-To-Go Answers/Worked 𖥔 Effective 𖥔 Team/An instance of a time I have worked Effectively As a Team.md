When I was at university, I was working in a bar in Shoreditch. The sort of place that closes at 3am. It was very hectic on a Friday and Saturday, and a lot of us were new staff so we didn’t have the experience you rely on when it’s busy. It was hard keeping on top of customers, making all the cocktails, keeping everything stocked, and shutting up swiftly at the end of the night so we could get home before 5am. 

  
As it turns out, however, all the staff got on very well. We worked out the roles we were all best at and began delegating each other tasks without any real managerial oversight. Sometimes it was explicit, sometimes we could see people just struggled with a given task. We communicated well. In the end, we could pre-empt what other staff would need or when problems were going to arise. We operated as a unit, really efficiently. Everyone could feel it. It was a dirty, grimy, sticky bar. But the staff side of it became smooth and sleek. It felt good.  
  
Not long after this zenith, staff hours were cut during the week to improve the bottom line so the business could be sold. Some people left and it immediately just fell back into chaos. But for a while, with the right team all working together, we ran a triple-A operation. Even the toilets were clean. I admit it was not a nice job, however it felt really good to work with competent people. I want to replicate that feeling of competency, or formidability. I want to come into work and quite happily stand at the foot of a mountain knowing I am a part of a unit that can conquer it.
