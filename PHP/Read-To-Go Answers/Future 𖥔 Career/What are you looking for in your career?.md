___
1). 

I want a job in which I can grow.

You can only go forward or backward, and so one has to push on constantly. As long as I am being challenged I can be 100% engaged. 
  
The technology industry is developing at an astounding rate. This is precisely the sort of environment that elicits the best from me. Being embedded in a competent team will give me the chance to fill gaps in my knowledge and contribute to a project far superior than I could manage independently.  


2).

The second point is something that is as much internal as it is related to my career. It is crucial that if I do something, I do it well. This is why I take my learning so seriously. If one is constantly improving, and they become a non-fungible asset in a team everything else will fall into place.

It's also why my job matters. I want to dedicate time to something worthwhile.


3). 

I think it’s also important to remember the technical and teamwork skills you pick up in your career feedback into your personal life. If you cultivate growth and competency in one environment the output will persist across all environments.
