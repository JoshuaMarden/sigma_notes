In 2018 I was completing my Neuroscience MSci. This involved handling lots of neuroimaging data and finding ways to plot it . The plotting was a particularly difficult task as the complex heatmaps I wanted to build couldn’t be constructed using out-of-the-box software. To plot this data I had to pick up command line and also learn ‘R’ (a language).  


I had never written any code before, didn’t know what an IDE (integrated development environment) was or any basic information about how computers handled data. But my solution was to just jump right it. I started reading forums, trying different inputs, and patching other people’s code together. Then, once I had something that might work, I started to reach out on those forums for help. Help didn’t come very quickly so I would experiment while I waited.  
  

The outcome was that I got an excellent graphical representation of my data. This was key not just to help examiners understand what I had found, but also to help myself. You understand: this was so complex I had no idea what the output might look like, it wasn't to decorate my dissertation with. Moreover I learnt that even though coding was mysterious and intimidating, if I stuck with it I could slowly teach myself. I learnt that if I was really persistent I could slowly do something that at the onset looked completely beyond my abilities.
