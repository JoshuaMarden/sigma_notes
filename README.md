# Sigma Notes

Are in markdown so will work well if you have got Obsidian or similar note software.

Basic Notes at the moment - better linking and templating should be used as time goes on.

Fork if you wish, but it will be best for my own Quad to just request to be collaborators.

If you can see important missing data or want to change things please ask to collaborate so the notes can be refined.

Add your own .gitignore file so that you can have a personal todo list / list of questions / personal notes
