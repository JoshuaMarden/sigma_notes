1. Problem Solving
	 - Read / understand / characterise the problem
	 - Do not jump to solving / coding
	 - Consider the 'base cases', inputs you expect. What _should_ their outputs be? This is really important for __TDD__.
	 - When designing a function/solution, try to  pre-empt 'edge cases'. This is also really important for __TDD__.

2. Modelling Problem

3. Algorithm

4. Test & Code

5. Reflection
