For this I would seriously just look at the [slides](https://app.excalidraw.com/l/6gPaBlSh8PG/9bSkGwf2QAE).

## Workshop Pre-work Notes

A client-server network is a form of internet network that consists of a single central computer functioning as a server and directing several other computers, referred to as clients. A server is a powerful computer that provides resources and services to other computers, called clients. Clients request information or services from the server, which processes the request and sends back a response. Clients can access shared files and information kept on the serving machine by connecting to the server. Unlike p2p networks, only the server may begin a transaction.

#### HTTP

1. HTTP - The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a communication protocol that forms the bedrock of the internet. HTTP allows computers to transfer information between computers connected by a network.
2. Response codes tell a user or systems whether their request for information was succesful, or if not, what the error was.
3. A HTTP method is a group of methods that tell a computer what action to perform. e.g. `connect` should connect two computers on the network


#### __Real life examples of Client/Server Relationships__


1. **A Catalogue Order Store (e.g. Argos)

**Client:** The customer using the Argos website or mobile app to browse and order products.
- **Role:** Initiates requests to view product information, place orders, and check order status.
**Server:** The Argos backend server.
- **Role:** Processes requests from the client, retrieves product information from the database, processes orders, and manages inventory.
**API:** The set of web services provided by Argos that allows interaction between the client and the server.
- **Role:** Defines the endpoints and methods the client can use to request product data, place orders, check order statuses, and more.


 2. **Sending a Letter to Someone Through the Post
 
**Client:** The sender of the letter.
- **Role:** Writes and prepares the letter, and sends it via the postal service.
**Server:** The postal service infrastructure (sorting facilities, mail carriers, etc.).
- **Role:** Handles the transport, sorting, and delivery of the letter to the recipient.
**API:** In this analogy, the postal service procedures and guidelines act as the "API."
- **Role:** Defines the methods (e.g., addressing, postage, mailing guidelines) that ensure the letter is delivered correctly.


3. **Accessing Street View on Google Maps for a Specific Address

**Client:** The user accessing Google Maps through a web browser or mobile app.
- **Role:** Requests to view the street view imagery for a specific address.
**Server:** Google's servers hosting the street view data.
- **Role:** Stores and retrieves the street view images and serves them to the client upon request.
**API:** Google Maps API, specifically the Street View service.
- **Role:** Provides the interface and methods for requesting street view images, including specifying the address, adjusting the view, and navigating through images.


 4. **Checking if a Library Has a Book for Borrowing
 
**Client:** The library patron (user) searching for a book.
- **Role:** Searches the library's online catalog to check the availability of a specific book.
**Server:** The library's catalog database server.
- **Role:** Stores information about the library's inventory and responds to queries about book availability.
**API:** The library's online catalog system, which may include a web-based interface and/or a backend API.
- **Role:** Defines the methods for searching the catalog, checking book availability, and possibly placing holds or reservations on books.
