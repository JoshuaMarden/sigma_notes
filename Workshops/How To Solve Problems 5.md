5. __Reflection__

	- Does it conform to __high quality__ code standards?
		- PEP8
		- Small functions
		- Well named
		- Well linted
		- handles errors
		- isn't repetetive

	- Does it perform well?
		-  This is not important in most instances
		- Most code is gone in a few years
		- Don't optimise prematurely

		    __Big O Notation__
		 - describes performance.
		 - O(1) means code always executes at same speed, regardless of input size
		 - O(n) Scales proportionally to input size.
		 - O(n^2) Exponentially increases 
			 -  Avoid nested loops that cause this!!
		- O(n^3) Bad. Steeper curve.
			- double nested loop. Don't do this.
		- Use [timecomplexity.ai](https://www.timecomplexity.ai/)if you want to see how bad your code is.
