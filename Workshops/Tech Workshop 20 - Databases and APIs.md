Chris just gave us an overview and demonstration of how to talk to your SQL database using python. This primed us for the coursework. 

Seems fairly straight forward.

__Key point:__ 
- DO AS MUCH AS YOU CAN IN SQL. Anything you are doing in python requires the data be brought over from the database.
- The database may not even be on the same server as your API!
