_What is 'containerisation'?_

Containerisation is the process of creating isolated virtual containers to run software. These can be can be made on multiple platforms, so that software can be made to run in a container and then work on multiple platforms. This makes it easier to port code about.

This is different from a virtual machine which virtualises not just the software, but even the hardware. Containerisation only takes place at the software level.

Examples of containerisation software include:
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- AWS ECS/EKS
- OpenShift
- Cloud Foundry
