_What is the difference Between an SQL TABLE and a VIEW?
##### Table:

- **Definition**: A table is a database object that stores data in rows and columns. It is a physical storage of data in the database.
- **Usage**: Tables are used to store persistent data that can be inserted, updated, deleted, and queried.
#### View:

- **Definition**: A view is a virtual table that is based on the result of a SELECT query. It does not store data physically but provides a way to look at data from one or more tables.
- **Usage**: Views are used to simplify complex queries, provide security by restricting access to certain columns or rows, and present data in a specific format.


_What is a 'common table expression' in SQL?_

- **Definition**: A Common Table Expression (CTE) is a temporary result set that you can reference within a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement. It is defined using the `WITH` keyword.
- **Usage**: CTEs are used to simplify complex queries, especially those involving recursive queries, and to improve readability and maintainability.


_How does GROUP BY work in SQL_

- **Definition**: The `GROUP BY` statement groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows. It is often used with aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `SUM`, `AVG`) to perform calculations on each group of rows.
- **Usage**: `GROUP BY` is used to arrange identical data into groups and to generate summary reports.
