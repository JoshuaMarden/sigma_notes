### Stand Up
___
Miles: Do prework, then move onto PHP
Lyes: PHP workshop to start with. Then move onto Blackjack.
Mabon: Still has to add dealer aces, unicode characters, maybe players. Workshop and prework.
Johnathan: Bit of testing, then do everything aside from BlackJack like PHP and capstone
Josh: PHP work. Prework. Then __maybe__ Above and Beyond.

### Useful Points
___
__From [[Tech Workshop 3 - Bug Squashing]]:

`Python`:

`is` works if the objects are immutable and share the same memory space.

main should be in an if statement:
`if __name__ == "__main__":`


Consider using logging over print statements. Will be covered in the future.

__From [Office Hours](https://github.com/Sigma-Labs-XYZ/Cohort-12-Workshop-Notes):

Lambdas allow for inline functions.
```python

# Lambas??

# This: 
multiplyer = lambda (input, multiplyer) : return input * multiplyer

# Same as this:
def multiply(input, multiplyer):
	return input * multiplyer


filtered_names = filter(lambda name: "i" in name, names)

``` 

`is` checks if memory address is same
`==` if memory address contain same data

learn about `map` and `filter` because these are really powerful.


### Wrap Up
___

Miles: PHP is done, bar one question. Trying to add betting. Struggling with maintaining a wallet / score between hands / games.

Lyes: 

Mabon: Mapped out what he want to write for PHP. Will flesh it out tonight.

Johnathan: Been very busy. Learnt how to use enumerate. Linted code.

Josh: Going to try to get multiplayers to have their turns.
