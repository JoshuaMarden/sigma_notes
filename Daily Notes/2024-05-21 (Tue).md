#### Office Hours Notes



__Q:__ Why does this return false?
``print(Card('3', 'D') == Card('3', 'D'))`
__A:__ These have different locations in memory. Use `__eq__` to see if they have the same attributes. This is because it depends on how == is implemented for a class (`Card`).

__Q:__ How does one break down large functions effectively?
__A__: Functions should really capture one, simple, identifiable mechanic/action/behaviour. Group code based with a view to the high-resolution problem that it solves. _Strictly_ speaking a function should do only one thing.
