__Hamoodi:__ Get started on coursework because it's API and networking. Has one question left for PHP.

__Lyes:__ Focus hard so that he doesn't get as bogged down as he did with OOP.

__Mabon:__ Day-less. So head down, work hard. Networks are alien to Mabon. 

__Jeremiah__: PHP from bullets to proper sentences. The focus on courtsework.

__Josh__: Polish off PHP and then hit the ground running to make up for the bank holiday and get as much out of the week as possible.

### Wrap Up
___
__Hamoodi:__ Prepped a lot for PHP. Will be working a lot in the evening. MO will be to do better tomorrow.

__Lyes:__ Would have liked to do more coursework and also get more PHP done. Did a lot of 121 time. Spent a little too much time reading. Maybe could have skipped what he knew. Will work towards Friday mock interview.

__Mabon:__ Â Got up until the aeroplane section of coursework. Not 100% on HTTP stuff but it doing okay. Happy with the little PHP he did. 121 could have gone better. Hoping to do a little better as time goes on. Try not to get in trouble this week for going off-piste as much.

__Jeremiah:__ Currently stuck trying to get an emoji flag to print from a countries API. Will move forward with coursework tomorrow. Jeremiah recommends stalking via linked in for possible placements.

__Josh__: Cracking on with coursework tomorrow. Looking forward to it. Looking forward to interview too. Generally happy.
