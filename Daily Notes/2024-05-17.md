### Stand Up
___
__Miles:__ 1Q to answer on PHP, and will look at making mastery quioz questions. After that, add betting to Blackjack.

__Lyes:__ Implementing Ace hi/lo, but has broken his tests. Has to do PHP.

__Mabon:__ Doing PHP, happy with Blackjack

__Johnathan:__ Tweaking PHP. Mastery Quiz, and _maybe_ add betting.

__Josh__: Lint code. Fix tests.


### Key Notes / Messages
___
- We SHOULD use global variables for things that NEVER change like `DAYS_IN_WEEK = 7` , `BLACKJACK_MAX_SCORE = 21` or `ATOMIC_MASS_H20 = 18.01528` etc

- Be using _guard clauses_!

- If you can __remove nested loops__ from your code, and that's all we do for now, Chris will be happy.
